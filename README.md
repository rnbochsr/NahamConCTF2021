### easb64

Was it a car or a cat I saw?
Download the file below.

This is a reverse text decode in `base64`. Use rev or tac to reverse the encoded text. 
Then decode using `base64 -d`. I did it in pieces first but you can do it in one step:
`rev esab64 | base64 -d | rev`
Reversing one last time puts the flag in the proper order. 


### Abyss
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
A Vortex? No... an Abyss.
Click the Start button on the top-right to start this challenge. 

This is a neverending stream of text and junk characters.
I hit `esc` and held it down to try and break it to no avail. I then tried to 
copy the text from my terminal into a text editor. Then search for `flag{`.
That gave me the answer that was buried in the abyss.


### Shoelaces
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
Do you double-knot your shoelaces? You gotta keep'em tied!
Download the file below.
Attachments: `shoelaces.jpg`.

Ran strings on the image file and got the flag.

### Car Keys
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
We found this note on someone's key chain! It reads... `ygqa{6y980e0101e8qq361977eqe06508q3rt}`? 
There was another key that was engraved with the word `QWERTY`, too... 

This is a QWERTY cipher. I just need to find the right movement and offset.
`ygqa` should equal `flag`, but I can't find an encoding that matches that.


### Chicken Wings
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
I ordered chicken wings at the local restaurant, but uh... this really isn't what I was expecting...

### $Echo
Author: @Blacknote#1337
So I just made a hardcoded bot that basically tells you what you wanna hear. Now usually it's 
a $ for each thing you want it to say but I'll waive the fee for you if you beta test it for me.

### Eight Circle
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here...

Attachments: `eight_circle`

This is a `Dante Cipher`. Need to find the proper encoding. 


### Pollex

Some people seem to have trouble reading this, understandably so. Sorry. The flag ends in these characters: 8fe36bc00}
Attachments: `pollex`

This is image manipulation. I tried `strings`. I tried `whirl and pinch` in GIMP.


### Veebee
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
Buzz buzz, can you find the honey?

### Bionic
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
Thank you for taking on The Mission. You can begin by exploring the CONSTELLATIONS public website, 
constellations.page. CONSTELLATIONS has "tried" to reduce their attack surface by offering just a 
static website. But you might find some low-hanging fruit to get you started. You should find the 
flag for this challenge ON THIS constellations.page website. 
With the flag of this challenge, you should also find a new URL that will assist in the next challenge.
After solving this challenge, you may need to refresh the page to see the newly unlocked challenges. 

Searched the page source and found nothing. 
Didn't see and hidden links or images on the page. 


### Treasure
Author: @congon4tor#2334
This movie is what pushed me to get into hacking. Good luck decrypting my note, I'm elite.
Download the files below.
Attachments: `note.txt` & `hackers.txt`

It is some cipher probably based on 13375p34k. I coudn't find the proper encoding.


### eaxy
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
Crypto is eaxy, it's all about math and keys :)
Download the file below.
Attachments: `eaxy`

Math and keys... Now I just have to figure them out. Could it be as easy as a ROT5 cipher?


### DDR
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
It's Dance Dance Revolution! You already know how to play!
Download the file below.
Attachments: `ddr.png`


### Dice Roll
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
When you have just one source of randomness, it's "a die", but when you can have muliple -- it's 'dice!'
NOTE: You are welcome to "brute force" this challenge if you feel you need to. ;)
Download the file below and press the Start button on the top-right to begin this challenge.
Attachments: `dice_roll.py`

You get the Python script. It seeds the dice, how ever many of them there are, 
with 32 bits of randomness. Now you have to guess the upcoming number. 


### Prison Break
Author: @JohnHammond#6971
Read the flag.txt file that is /just/out/of/reach.
Press the Start button on the top-right to begin this challenge. 

This is a priveledge escalation challenge.


### AgentTester
Author: @jorgectf#3896

let us know if you find any errors!
