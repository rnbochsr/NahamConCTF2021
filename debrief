No flag here, sorry :)

If you are interested in hearing the organizer's perspective on this CTF, please join me in 
a livestream debrief at 11:00 AM ET on March 15th. I will share some statistics, the feedback 
we received, the ideas behind challenges, and anything else you would like. It is a livestream 
so you can certainly ask questions in the chat!
